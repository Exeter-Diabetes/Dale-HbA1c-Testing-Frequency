# Introduction

This is the GitHub to provide the code for the manuscript entitled "Depression increases both glycated haemoglobin testing frequency and risk of all-cause mortality in type 2 diabetes"
(https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.06.25337242v1).

These scripts are designed to reproduce the dataset as defined in this manuscript, using the CPRD Aurum 2023 December release. Please see the supplementary methods/results of the manuscript
for all code lists used in these scripts. Alternatively, most of the code lists are also available at: 
https://github.com/Exeter-Diabetes/CPRD-Codelists

Prior to running these scripts, the data set should be curated according to previous work:
